Certainly! Let's break down the provided Rust program step by step:

1. **Imports and Constants**:
    - Libraries and modules that the program needs are imported at the beginning.
    - A constant `DEFAULT_DIR` is defined to specify the directory where crawled HTML pages will be saved.

2. **main() function**:
    - The program starts executing from the `main()` function.
    - The user is prompted to enter an initial URL to start crawling.
    - A `HashSet` named `visited` is initialized to keep track of all URLs the program has already visited (to avoid infinite loops or redundant requests).
    - The program starts crawling from the provided URL by calling the `crawl()` function.

3. **crawl() function**:
    - First, it checks if the URL has already been visited. If it has, the function returns immediately.
    - If not visited, it marks the URL as visited and prints it.
    - An HTTP GET request is made to fetch the content of the URL using `reqwest::blocking::get()`.
    - The content (body) of the response is saved to a local file using the `save_to_file()` function.
    - The content is then parsed as an HTML document.
    - The program looks for all `<a>` (anchor) tags in the HTML, which typically represent hyperlinks.
    - For each link found, the program constructs its absolute URL (if the link is relative) and recursively calls the `crawl()` function for that new URL. This ensures that the program traverses all linked pages.
    - However, before making the recursive call, the program checks whether the link is of the "http" or "https" scheme using the `is_http_or_https()` function, to avoid trying to fetch non-webpage URLs (e.g., "mailto:").

4. **save_to_file() function**:
    - This function takes a URL and its content as arguments.
    - It generates a unique filename for the content by hashing the URL. This ensures that each URL's content is saved in a distinct file.
    - If the target directory (`DEFAULT_DIR`) doesn't exist, it creates it.
    - It then saves the content to a file within that directory.

5. **is_http_or_https() function**:
    - This utility function checks if a given URL is of the "http" or "https" scheme, returning `true` if it is, and `false` otherwise.

6. **Error Handling**:
    - Throughout the program, the `?` operator is used after operations that can potentially fail. This means that if an error occurs, the function will return early, propagating the error upwards. At the top level, in the `main()` function, if an error is propagated all the way up, the program will terminate and display the error.

In essence, this program is a simple web crawler. Starting from a user-provided URL, it fetches the content of that URL, saves it locally, and then looks for links in that content to further crawl. The crawling process continues recursively, branching out as it discovers new links, but always ensuring it doesn't revisit URLs it's already processed.

Certainly, we can modify the code to make it more robust and handle situations where an URL does not respond immediately. One way to achieve this is by using Tokio's timeout function to set a timer for each HTTP request. If the request takes longer than a specified duration, we can consider it as a timeout and move on to the next URL.

Here's the updated code with the modifications:

With the addition of the timeout option in the HTTP client builder, the code will wait for a specified duration (in seconds) for each HTTP request. If the request does not respond within that duration, the request will be canceled, and the crawler will move on to the next URL without getting stuck indefinitely. This improvement should make the crawler more robust and handle unresponsive URLs more gracefully.

That code throws the following error:

I apologize for the inconvenience. The error you are encountering is likely caused by a compatibility issue with the Windows linking toolchain.

To address this, we can modify the build target to use the default Rust linker instead of the mingw-w64 linker. This can be done by setting the environment variable CARGO_TARGET_X86_64_PC_WINDOWS_GNU_LINKER to "rust-lld".

Here's how you can update your Cargo.toml file to include this setting:

toml
Copy code
[build]
target = "x86_64-pc-windows-gnu"

[target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu]
rustflags = ["-C", "linker=rust-lld"]
With this configuration, Cargo will use the rust-lld linker instead of the mingw-w64 linker when building for the x86_64-pc-windows-gnu target.

After making these changes, try building and running the project again with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
cargo build
cargo run
This should resolve the linking issue and allow the code to compile and run without errors. If you encounter any other issues or error messages, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.

That code returns the following errors:

Apologies for the confusion. It appears that there might be some compatibility issues with using the rust-lld linker on Windows. Instead, we can try specifying the default system linker by removing the target setting in the Cargo.toml file.

Here's the updated Cargo.toml:

toml
Copy code
[build]
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=-fuse-ld=lld-link"]

[dependencies]
scraper = "0.12"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
reqwest = "0.11"
Now, let's remove the target.x86_64-pc-windows-gnu.rustflags and target sections from the Cargo.toml file.

After making these changes, try building and running the project again with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
cargo build
cargo run
This should resolve the linking issue, and the code should compile and run without errors.

If you still encounter any issues, please provide the error messages you're seeing, and I'll be glad to assist further.

OK produce the Cargo.toml file again please.

Apologies for the confusion earlier. Here's the updated Cargo.toml file without specifying the target:

toml
Copy code
[package]
name = "lazy_domain_crawler"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
scraper = "0.12"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
reqwest = "0.11"
With this Cargo.toml, you can try building and running the project again with the following commands:

bash
Copy code
cargo build
cargo run
This should resolve the linking issue, and the code should compile and run without errors. If you encounter any other issues or error messages, please let me know, and I'll be happy to assist further.

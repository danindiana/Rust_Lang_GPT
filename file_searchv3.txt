The program is designed to search for files containing the search string in their names, but it doesn't support wildcard characters like *. If you enter *.pdf, it will look for files that literally have *.pdf in their names, rather than all files with the .pdf extension.

To search for all files with a specific extension, like .pdf, you can modify the search_files function to check if the file extension matches the search string.

Here is the modified search_files function that supports searching by file extension:

This modified search_files function supports two kinds of search strings:

If the search string starts with *. followed by an extension (e.g. *.pdf), it will search for files with that extension.
Otherwise, it will search for files containing the search string in their names.
With this modification, you should be able to search for .pdf files by entering *.pdf as the search string. Also, please make sure you enter valid directory paths to search within, and type 'done' when you have finished entering directories.

Trying to install CUDA, pytorch, etc. on windows 10 and get this message:  The script pip3.10.exe is installed in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64\Scripts' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.
  The script wheel.exe is installed in 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64\Scripts' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

What should I do to add the directory to PATH?

The warning message you're getting means that the system can't find the directory 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64\Scripts' in your PATH environment variable. The PATH environment variable is a system variable that your operating system uses to locate needed executables from the command line or Terminal window.

To add the directory to PATH on Windows 10, you can follow these steps:

1. Search for 'Environment Variables' in the Windows search bar and select 'Edit the system environment variables'.
2. In the System Properties window that pops up, click on the 'Environment Variables' button.
3. In the Environment Variables window, under the 'System variables' section, find and select the 'Path' variable, then click on 'Edit'.
4. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on 'New' and then paste the directory 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64\Scripts'.
5. Click 'OK' on all windows to close them.

After following these steps, the directory should be added to your PATH, and your system should be able to find the pip3.10.exe and wheel.exe scripts.

You need to restart any open command line or PowerShell windows for the changes to take effect. You can check whether the directory was added successfully by opening a new command line window and typing `echo %PATH%`. The directory you added should appear in the list.

I get the following error when attempting to run: py -m pip install nvidia-pyindex


 RuntimeError: C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64\python.exe: can't open file 'Files': [Errno 2] No such file or directory

      [end of output]

  note: This error originates from a subprocess, and is likely not a problem with pip.
  ERROR: Failed building wheel for nvidia-pyindex

ERROR: Could not build wheels for nvidia-pyindex, which is required to install pyproject.toml-based projects

The issue here seems to be that the Python executable path has spaces, i.e., 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64\python.exe'. This might cause problems when running commands, as it interprets each space-separated part as a separate argument. In this case, it is trying to open a file named 'Files', which does not exist.

Here are a few options you might consider to solve this problem:

1. **Install Python in a directory without spaces:** You can reinstall Python in a directory path without spaces, for example, 'C:\Python37', and then add this new path to the system PATH as explained in the previous response. Make sure you uninstall the existing Python before reinstalling to avoid conflicts.

2. **Use short path notation:** Windows supports a short path notation (DOS-compatible) for locations with spaces in their names. For instance, 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64' might be referenced as 'C:\Progra~2\Micros~1\Shared\Python37_64' or similar. You can find out the correct short path using the command `dir /X` in the Command Prompt at the root directory.

3. **Use quotes when executing commands with paths:** If the path is given as a command-line argument, you can also use quotes to make sure the entire path is interpreted as a single argument. For example, you can try running `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\Shared\Python37_64\python.exe" -m pip install nvidia-pyindex`.

Please try these potential solutions and see if any of them resolve your issue.
